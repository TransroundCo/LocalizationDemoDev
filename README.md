App Localization Demo
===========
The main purpose for this app to show the power and fun translating an Android app on the phone.

In order to support this kind of translation of an app you need to build in a plugin (Nativer SDK) into the app.
The plugin together with detailed implementation instructions is also available on Github (https://github.com/Transround/NativerSDK).

1. Download the source code of this demo app, compile and try it.
2. Download the plugin and build it into the demo app based on the instructions.
3. If you start the app (extended with the plugin) an intro screen will guide you through the basic usage scenarios.

If first you would like to try the demo app itself, you can download it from [Google Play] (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.transround.localizationdemo&utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=developer).

Let us know if you have any questions, suggestions either by using the feedback button of the demo app or by sending an email to info@transround.com.

Thank you,
Transround team
