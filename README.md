<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Register your app:</strong></p>

<p>Select <strong><em>Catalog -&gt; Applications and Categories </em></strong>page. You will see something similar as in the picture below:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Press the <strong>Insert application </strong>button.<br />
Enter the package name of your application as seen below (in place of <em>eu.appround.highwayportal </em>please enter<br />
the package name your application has been uploaded to Google Play with)</p>

<p>When ready, press the <strong>Download / reload application data from Google Play </strong>button</p>

<p>Now please be patient for a while. The Nativer server will find your application on Google Play,<br />
will download from there all the public data, and will populate all the relevant fields (name, merketing text, icon, etc.).<br />
This may take a few seconds, sometimes even a minute.<br />
When finished, you will see the result similar to the picture below.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the fileds were populated, press the <strong>Save </strong>button. The screen will show something similar to the picture below.<br />
The status of you application will be &quot;<em>Unconfirmed</em>&quot;, similar to the application on the picture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Registration confirmation</strong>:</p>

<p>Nativer sends registration link to the app market contact (this does not need to be the same contact for Nativer).<br />
So it is time to check the mailbox. You should receive in short time an email from our system<br />
wich has the aim to help us confirm that you are really the owner/developer of the freshly registered application.<br />
If you do not receive our email within few hours, please also check the spam folder for it.<br />
The email will be something very similar to this:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://nativer01.nativer.com/prod/image/data/ImagesforDeveloperProcess/RegisterApp_Picture05_AppOwnershipConfirmationLetter.jpg" style="height:248px; width:447px" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By clicking the confirmation link in the email the application gets registered to you<br />
under <em>Catalog -&gt; Applications and Categories </em>the application status changes to &ldquo;<em>In preparation (confirmed)</em>&rdquo;.<br />
If you check your application&#39;s status, it will look like in the picture below:</p>
