App Localization Demo
===========
The main purpose for this app to show the power and fun translating an Android app on the phone.

In order to support this kind of translation of an app you need to build in a plugin (Nativer SDK) into the app.
The plugin together with detailed implementation instructions is also available on Github (https://github.com/Transround/NativerSDK).

1. Download the source code of this demo app and compile it.
2. Download the plugin and build it into the demo app.
3. If you start the app (extended with the plugin) an intro screen will guide you through the basic usage scenarios.
